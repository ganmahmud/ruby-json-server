This is a simple JSON server implemented in Ruby on Rails for creating a fake API based on a JSON file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- Rails

### Endpoints
```
GET /:resource: Retrieve all items of a specific resource.
GET /:resource/:id: Retrieve a specific item by ID.
POST /:resource: Create a new item for a specific resource.

## Example
Assuming we have the following JSON data structure:

  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "First Post", "author": "Alice" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "Second Post", "author": "Bob" },
    { "id": 3, "title": "Third Post", "author": "Charlie" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "Great post!", "postId": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "body": "Interesting read.", "postId": 1 },
    { "id": 3, "body": "Looking forward to more.", "postId": 2 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "Json Server", "version": "1.0" }
